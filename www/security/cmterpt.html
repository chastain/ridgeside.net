			<h3><i>Ridgeside Security Committee May Report</i></h3>
			<hr align="left" noshade size="1" width="200">
			<h4>Committee Report to the Ridgeside City Commission</h4>
			<p>Ridgeside Community Meeting - May 25th, 2004</p>
			<p>Report from Safety and Security Committee</p>
			<p>Recent reports of damaged and destroyed mailboxes in the past 2 -3 months along with several car break-ins in the City of Ridgeside show the need for more security. Additional police patrolling has been requested in the past, and is being requested again. We seem to get less patrol as time goes on.</p>
			<p>Ridgeside residents have been informed that mail-box damage should be reported to the federal government. Federal Postal Inspection Service (499-8210).</p>
			<p>Residents are encouraged to report all suspicious activity to the East Ridge Police Department.</p>
			<p>Specifically, residents have been asked to be on the lookout for young white males in a white Honda that were seen trying to break in to a car parked on the street in Ridgeside.</p>
			<p>Several requests have been made for the commissioners to investigate 'gating' the community, installing video surveillance cameras, and providing full-time, night-time security patrol.</p>
			<p>Other topics for security and safety measures include the following:</p>
			<p>1) The dogwood tree at the corner of Brookwood Dr. and Hilldale Dr. is blocking the Stop sign. Several non-residents and residents have been seen running this Stop sign. The tree needs to be trimmed to provide a view of the sign.</p>
			<p>2) Regarding the renters at Joujan's house on Crescent Park:  the garage renter has moved out per the request from owner Janet Joujan.  The renter in the main house is ignoring the request to evacuate.  Both eviction notices were delivered, by mail, by Ms. Joujan in January.  Neighbors have stated that they will petition Ms. Joujan regarding being an absentee landlord and specifically related to the current renter whose son has been sentenced twice on multiple counts of theft in the neighborhood.  The son, Tommy Willis, recently was found guilty, in federal court,  of multiple theft charges in Ridgeside and elsewhere, and received a suspended sentence with supervised parole.  If this person - Tommy C. Willis -is seen in the neighborhood, residents should call the federal parole officer.</p>
			<p>3) Cars continue to be parked 24 hours a day at the addresses:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>209 Brookwood Drive<br>
					209 Windmere Dr.<br>
					205 Windmere Dr.<br>
					107 Ridgeside Road<br>
					104 Ridgeside Road<br>
					12 Ridgeside Road<br>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Each of these residents has a driveway and an off-street place to park. Parking permanently on the street is not permitted in Hamilton County. This presents a hazard to neighborhood children ..</p>
			<p>4) Residents continue to run the stop signs at Brookwood and Hilldale. Many children reside in this area and ride their bicycles here as well.</p>
			<p>Thank you for your consideration of these issues.</p>
			<p>Respectfully submitted, Janet Jobe, Chair</p>
