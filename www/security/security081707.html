		<h3 class="parHeading3 ds1"><span class="ds2">Street Closings:</span></h3>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="ds1"><span class="ds2">Mayor Mason and I met with State Senator Bo Watson, and Michael Tallent of MTAS, an agency of the University of Tennessee that provides assistance to the operation of municipalities. These were done on separate occasions, but the conclusions were basically the same: We have the right to close streets, but must have approved by city ordinance, and present our plans to the Hamilton County Regional Planning Agency.</span></p>
		</blockquote>
		<h3 class="parHeading3 ds1"><span class="ds2">Surveillance Equipment:</span></h3>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="ds1"><span class="ds2">No decision at this time.</span></p>
		</blockquote>
		<h3 class="parHeading3 ds1"><span class="ds2">Patrol Presence:</span></h3>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="ds1"><span class="ds2">Continues on the same expanded hours as previous in addition to the use of unmarked cars. However, if you see a suspicious car report it to the police with license tag, if possible. The police dispatcher knows who is patrolling our area. The officer may be in plain clothes but will have his badge on his belt.</span></p>
		</blockquote>
		<h3 class="parHeading3 ds1"><span class="ds2">Long Range Committee:</span></h3>
		<blockquote>
			<h3 class="parHeading3 ds1"><span class="ds2">This committee has a scheduled meeting to discuss lighting options.</span></h3>
		</blockquote>
		<h3 class="parHeading3 ds1"><span class="ds2">Neighborhood Watch (Security) Committee:</span></h3>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="ds1"><span class="ds2">Also has a scheduled meeting. If anyone is interested in joining this committee, you may call or email Karen Page or me. Our numbers are in the community telephone book. This will be a meeting with a specific agenda based on ideas gathered from concerned citizens, and a comments portion afterward. Some of these citizens will receive an invitation to join. This is not going to be a meeting to vent or rant, and people who participate should envision a long term commitment to this program to be a part of it.</span></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p class="ds1"><span class="ds2">Commissioner Dunagan represented Ridgeside at the Chattanooga Police Services Center as part of the newly formed Citizens/Police Interactive Committee serving the Brainerd, North Brainerd, and Eastdale area. This was hosted by Chattanooga Police Chief Freeman Cooper along with available Captains and Lieutenants within the department. This meeting included neighborhoods from all over Chattanooga.</span></p>
			<p class="ds1"><span class="ds2">I have plotted all criminal activity that has occurred over the last two and a half months with day, date, and time on a map of the city. The plot is assisting us and the ERPD in adjusting the off-duty police officers schedule.</span></p>
			<p class="ds1"><span class="ds2">When reporting incidents to our Ridgeside email service please be sensitive to our neighbors who suffered a property loss.  It is important to know the day, date, time, and address of the crime, and any suspicious activity that anyone may have noted when reporting.</span></p>
			<p class="ds1"><span class="ds2">If Ridgeside residents have a specific question or an idea for improvement of our fine city, call or email one of the city commissioners,</span></p>
