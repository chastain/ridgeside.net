			<p>(Accompanying Photographs BY JOHN SENTELL)</p>
			<p>NEWS RELEASE</p>
			<p>The East Ridge Fire Rescue Department responded to two separate fires today with the second alarm sounding while crews were working at the first alarm.</p>
			<p>The first alarm came into the 9-1-1 Center at approximately 2:55 PM and was located at an apartment at 1107 Altamaha Street. A neighbor to the apartment called 9-1-1 after coming home from work and noticing the upstairs apartment had a broken window and appeared to have been burned. Firefighters responded to find the apartment had sustained heavy fire and smoke damage but had burned its self out. An unknown white male was located in the apartment and was pronounced dead at the scene. The cause of the fire, it's exact location, and approximate time of catching fire is under investigation by the East Ridge Fire Investigators. The body was transported to the Hamilton County Forensics Center for an autopsy to try and determine the cause of death. The name and age of the male is not being released at this time due to the ongoing investigation and the notifying of family members.</p>
			<p>Firefighters then quickly responded to 5804 Clover Street at approximately 4:13 PM on a reported house fire. An engine company from the Fort Oglethorpe Fire Rescue Department assisted two engines companies, one ladder company, three squad companies and two rescue squads from the East Ridge Fire Rescue Department, under the command of Deputy Chief Ken Gann to find a house fully engulfed in fire. Firefighters quickly brought the fire under control with investigators now trying to determine where and how this fire started. There was no one home at the time of the fire and all family members have been accounted for. No injuries were reported.</p>
			<p>Firefighters in the pictures are Firefighters Jeff Duncan and Lt. Brent Massey.</p>
