  <h2 class="text-center p-4 shadow whitestripe">Ridgeside Gallery</h2>

  <h4 class="text-center p-2">Suburban living, Urban convenience</h4>
  <p class="container p-3">A small suburban community, Ridgeside is located on the east side of historic Missionary Ridge smack dab in the middle of bustling Chattanooga. Ridgeside is only minutes by automobile to the resurgent Chattanooga downtown with its restaurants, shops, galleries, hiking and cycling trails. Erlanger, Memorial, and Parkridge hospitals are within a short drive. The Univeristy of Tennessee at Chattanooga is but seven minutes over the ridge and down McCallie Avenue from the community.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Ridgeside Park</h2>
            <p class="text-left">Ridgesiders who live on the south side of Hilldale Drive and the north side of Ridgeside Road claim their homes are the best located in the community. Their properties border the pastoral park that stretches from the community pool on Shepherd Avenue. down the hill to Brookwood Drive. The little park was the site of the Ridgeside’s famous 1920s miniature golf course. The golf course, most of which is now long replaced by homes, existed along the little brook that still flows through the valley. Most of the stream was covered in the early days of Ridgeside, but portions still babble along. </p>
            <p class="text-left">The park is the site of the community pool, tennis courts, a playground, and a pathway though a stand of old trees, some of which are said date to the 1860s. The park and pool are community favorites for swimming, tennis, walking, bicycling, and children’s play. </p>

            <p class="text-left">Children have for generations played in the Ridgeside Park and on the park’s playground toys. Over the years the swings, climbing structures, tables, and benches have been replaced a number of times, always with goals of safety and durability. </p>
            <p class="text-left">The area is a destination-rest stop for parents walking little children. The huge shade trees overhanging the area create a cool spot for child play and adult meditation. </p>
            <p class="text-left">The little brook that runs the length of the park goes underground on one side of the playground and reappears on the other. </p>
            <p class="text-left">The area is maintained by the community’s parks committee. The committee of volunteers also oversees the maintenance and management of the community pool. </p>

            <p class="text-left">Ridgeside’s community pool is the second on the site. In the late 1970s the first pool needed extensive repairs. A new, enlarged pool and pool house replaced the old one, and it was, until 2015, a center of community activity. The 1970s pool succumbed to the rigors of age. In 2016, community leaders were forced to close the pool. It remained closed for two seasons. During its closing, the facility was completely remodeled from foundation to lifeguard chairs. </p>
            <p class="text-left">The new pool's first full season of use is 2018.</p>
            <p class="text-left">The pool is the home to the community's <a href="https://ridgesidepool200.wixsite.com/website">Ridgeside Dolphins swim team</a>, and the pool house serves as the voting venue for local, state, and national elections. Pool regulations and fees are available for download through the links below.</p>
