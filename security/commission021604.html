		<h4>SAFETY ISSUE OF DOUBLE PARKING ON RIDGESIDE ROAD</h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The Safety Committee has identified a safety problem on the upper end of Ridgeside Road when cars park on both sides of the road. The passing part of the street becomes so narrow that only one car can pass through at a time, and visibility is decreased causing a hazardous situation, particularly with children and dogs in the area.</p>
			<p>The Commissioners of Ridgeside ask that from Shallowford to Rowe Road parking take place only on the North side of the street and that parking on the street be limited to temporary purposes only (hours not days).</p>
			<p>If you have workmen, please notify them to park only on the North side. Residents should have an &quot;<img src="../../resources/ridgesideRs.gif" alt="R" height="38" width="36" border="0">&quot; decal on the rear of car. If you need a decal, call or email <a title="email" href="mailto:elecooper@comcast.net">Eleanor Cooper</a>.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>CARE OF RIIDGESIDE PARK</h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Ridgeside park has suffered damage in recent months due to illegal vehicular use of the park.</p>
			<p>The use of motorized vehicles in the park is prohibited.</p>
			<p>The prohibition includes service vehicles, cars, work vans, motorcycles and recreational equipment (with the exception of authorized maintenance).</p>
			<p>The residents who live along the park can be particularly helpful in guarding against such misuse and protecting the park. Please speak directly to anyone who abuses the park. A chain has been re-installed across the park entrance at Brookwood.</p>
			<p>No vehicular entry is allowed from the pool side. The walk path that the Park Committee installed two years ago has been heavily damaged by illegal truck entry. This path is a foot path only. If the misuse continues, or if you need to request entry into the back of your house for extenuating purposes, please notify one of the commissioners below.</p>
